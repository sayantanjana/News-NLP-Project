# Evaluate a news article with Natural Language Processing

## Description

This is a web tool that allows users to run Natural Language Processing (NLP) on articles or blogs found on other websites. Using an exciting new api called Aylien, I built a simple web interface to interact with their NLP system. This tool will give us back pertinent information about the article, like whether the content is subjective (opinion) or objective (fact-based) and whether it is positive, neutral, or negative in tone.


## Configurations
Here, we have two webpack config files for both development mode(`webpack.config.dev.js`) and production mode(`webpack.config.prod.js` )

We also have a `package.json` to manage dependencies


## API

The project uses the Text Analysis SDKs from [aylien](https://aylien.com/text-api/sdks/), which provides a powerful and flexible AI-driven content analysis solutions.
